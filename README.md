## Setting Up a JSON Editor Web App

### Prerequisites:

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed to run the Flask server. You can [download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **pip**: `pip` is the package installer for Python and usually comes bundled with Python installations.

- **Flask**: Once Python and pip are installed, install Flask using the following command:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Project Setup:

1. **Create a new directory for the project**:

```bash
mkdir json_editor_app
cd json_editor_app
```

2. **Set up the folder structure**:

```bash
mkdir static templates static/js
touch app.py
touch templates/index.html
touch static/js/script.js
```

Your directory structure should look like this:

```
json_editor_app/
│
├── static/
│   └── js/
│       └── script.js
│
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
│
└── app.py
```

3. **Copy the Provided Code**:

- Paste the given `app.py` code into your `app.py` file.
- Paste the provided `index.html` content into `templates/index.html`.
- Copy the `script.js` content into `static/js/script.js`.

4. **Run the Flask App**:

In the `json_editor_app` directory, use the following command to start the server:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start your server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

5. **Access in a Browser**:

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### Additional Notes:

- **Debug Mode**: The application is set to run in debug mode (`debug=True`) for development purposes. This mode is not recommended for production deployments.

- **Enhancements**: If you're thinking of deploying this for broader use, consider integrating with cloud storage or databases to make the application more robust.

- **Frontend**: For a polished UI, you might want to integrate frontend frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation.

- **Security**: This application is meant for local use and does not come with extensive security features. Ensure you incorporate standard security practices if you plan to deploy it in a real-world scenario.
